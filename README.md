# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Customer Reviews

This project performs **Sentiment Analysis** on Amazon customer reviews using two popular NLP approaches:

- **NLTK's VADER** (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)
- 🤗 **Hugging Face Transformers** with the **RoBERTa** model

The goal is to classify each review into **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** sentiment and **compare the performance** of both methods.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Sentiment analysis is a key technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for understanding opinions and emotions in text data. In this project, we:

- Use VADER from NLTK for rule-based sentiment scoring.
- Use a pretrained RoBERTa model from Hugging Face Transformers for deep learning-based classification.
- Compare the outputs and performance of both models on Amazon product review data.
