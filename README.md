# üß† Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Customer Reviews

This project performs **Sentiment Analysis** on Amazon customer reviews using two popular NLP approaches:

* **NLTK's VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)**
* **Hugging Face Transformers using the RoBERTa model**

The goal is to classify each review into **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** sentiment and **compare the performance** of both methods.

## üîç Project Overview

Sentiment analysis is a fundamental technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that identifies and extracts subjective information from text. This project includes:

* VADER Sentiment Analysis (rule-based model for social media texts).
* RoBERTa Transformer (deep learning-based model from Hugging Face).
* Visual and comparative analysis of both models.

## üì¶ Tech Stack

* **Python 3.8+**
* **NLTK** (for VADER)
* **Hugging Face Transformers** (RoBERTa)
* **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
* **Torch** (PyTorch backend)

### 1. **VADER (NLTK)**

* Rule-based sentiment analyzer.
* Efficient for short, informal texts like reviews and social media.
* Outputs compound sentiment score.

### 2. **RoBERTa (Hugging Face Transformers)**

* Deep learning model pretrained on large corpora.
* Uses context-aware attention mechanisms.
* Returns logits for each sentiment class.
